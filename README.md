# NG-30-Days-of-Learning

## Day 1:
We were introduced to Microsoft Excel's Analyse Data function that help you to analyse data and suggests charts and Pivot tables that might be useful in your analysis. We used a sample Financial dataset to produce samplt charts and pivot tables.

## Day 2
We were taught how to scrape Covid19 data from [this github page](https://github.com/CSSEGISandData/COVID-19/tree/master/csse_covid_19_data/csse_covid_19_time_series). Using Power Query, we were able to transform the data from wide to long format, rename columns and merge datasets to create a master dataset. This dataset is directly connected to the github page and updates the master dataset automatically.

# NG-30-Days-of-Learning

## Day 1:
We were introduced to Microsoft Excel's Analyse Data function that help you to analyse data and suggests charts and Pivot tables that might be useful in your analysis. We used a sample Financial dataset to produce samplt charts and pivot tables.

## Day 2
We were taught how to scrape Covid19 data from [this github page](https://github.com/CSSEGISandData/COVID-19/tree/master/csse_covid_19_data/csse_covid_19_time_series). Using Power Query, we were able to transform the data from wide to long format, rename columns and merge datasets to create a master dataset. This dataset is directly connected to the github page and updates the master dataset automatically.

## Day 4
We were shown how to make No-Code Dashboards. We integrated Microsoft Power BI to; 
* Microsoft Teams to analyze Team activity 
* Sharepoint, where we uploaded the Financial Sample Data from Day 1 to a site and generated a dashboard without doing anything.
* Powerpoint, where we can upload dashboard links to powerpoint slides and have dashboards that change in real-time for presentations.

## Day 3
We created a Dashboard with Microsoft Excel using the Covid 19 data that we scraped in Day 2. We created pivot tables and different types of charts, we used slicers to make filters and we added images to the dashboard.

## Day 5
Today, we had a meeting with industry experts on what it meant to work as a data analyst in corporate settings. The meeting was tagged "A Day in the life of a Data Analyst". We got to hear first hand stories of how our guests were able to break into the data space. Career advice was given to we who wanted to start our journey, and they answered the questions we had about their journey.

## Day 6/7
Weekend! We did a recap of the activities and were encouraged to register for the Cloud skill challenge where were to complete a number of modules under the Data Analysis with Power BI track.
